Sales Data Analysis with Python and Excel Integration 
Project Overview
This project is designed to perform sales data analysis using Python, Excel, and Streamlit. The application reads sales data from an Excel file, performs basic data analysis, and displays the results in an interactive dashboard. The dashboard allows users to interact with the data, applying various sorting mechanisms and viewing different types of charts for a comprehensive understanding of the sales trends.

Features
Excel Data Integration: Utilizes the Openpyxl and Pandas libraries for seamless reading and manipulation of Excel files.
Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit and Plotly, providing dynamic visualizations and user interaction.
Data Visualization: Supports multiple chart types, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
Sorting Mechanisms: Allows users to sort data based on different criteria for customized analysis.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to manage data loading issues, invalid user inputs, and other potential errors gracefully.

main.py
The main.py script is the heart of the project. It is responsible for initializing the Streamlit dashboard, loading and processing the Excel data, generating visualizations, and handling user interactions.

Visualization Techniques
Bar Chart: Displays the sales performance across different categories.
Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of sales across various segments.
Line Chart: Tracks sales trends over time.

Sorting Mechanisms
Alphabetical Sorting: Sorts data alphabetically by product name or category.
Numerical Sorting: Sorts data based on numerical values such as sales amount or quantity.
Date Sorting: Orders data chronologically.

Error Handling
The project includes error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation:

File Not Found Error: Checks if the Excel file is present in the specified directory before loading.
Data Type Errors: Validates the data types in the Excel file to ensure compatibility with the analysis.
User Input Validation: Ensures that user inputs for sorting and chart selection are valid.
